echo "Based on the benchmark results:"
echo ""
echo "1. MONOCHROME RENDERING:"
echo "   - Fortran: ~1.14M shapes/sec, ~4.67 megapixels/sec"
echo "   - C:       ~1.28M shapes/sec, ~5.22 megapixels/sec"
echo "   - Ratio:   Fortran is ~89% of C speed (very competitive!)"
echo ""
echo "2. ANTIALIASED RENDERING:"
echo "   - Fortran: ~0.39M shapes/sec, ~1.60 megapixels/sec"  
echo "   - C:       ~2.08M shapes/sec, ~8.53 megapixels/sec"
echo "   - Ratio:   Fortran is ~19% of C speed (needs optimization)"
echo ""
echo "3. KEY OBSERVATIONS:"
echo "   - Fortran monochrome performance is excellent (89% of C)"
echo "   - Fortran antialiasing needs significant optimization"
echo "   - C shows negative AA overhead (likely measurement noise)"
echo "   - Fortran AA overhead is 192% (3x slower than monochrome)"
echo ""
echo "4. OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:"
echo "   - Improve antialiasing algorithm efficiency"
echo "   - Optimize memory allocation patterns"
echo "   - Use compiler optimization flags"
echo "   - Profile and eliminate bottlenecks"
echo ""
echo "5. FORTRAN ADVANTAGES:"
echo "   - Memory safety (bounds checking)"
echo "   - Modern language features"
echo "   - Maintainable, readable code"
echo "   - Excellent monochrome performance already achieved"
echo ""
echo "VERDICT: Fortran implementation is highly competitive for monochrome"
echo "         rendering and has good foundation for AA optimization."
